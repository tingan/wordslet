The format for input words or term, definition pair is one **comma separated** term, definition pair per line.

```
term1, definition1
term2, definition2
```

As mobile is clumsy to input large text, **it's recommened to input the comma separated content in computer and then copy them to mobile** by other tools such as WhatsApp, Wechat, Dropbox or email etc.

- Users can also input a URL whose content is above comma separated content. There are many way to get such URL, e.g. create a github repo and input formatted text as shown in following image, or use Dropbox or other internet disk such as Amazon S3 disk. The following image shows a github repo's dictionary content, click the "Raw" button will get the URL for importing.

  **Duplicate terms will be ignored during importing.** It's important to format
  the content correctly, e.g. use comma to separate terma and definition, no extra
  comma at the end of line, spaces around comma or term and definition is allowed.
  The line which has format errors will be skipped, other correct lines will still
  be imported.
