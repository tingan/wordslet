# Quiz

The quiz screen show flashcards or carousel of questions. Users can toggle answer with definition or answer with term. Users can also configure interval of flashcard play and how many questions to generate. The maximum questions to generate for one session is limited to 100. The reason is that too many cards will deteriorate mobile performance. The default number of questions is 50. However, users can click shuffle button to generate more new questions.
