# Introduction

This is the support documentation site for [Wordslet App](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/wordslet-lite/id6448799708).

## The story and motivation

Every app need a story or motivation. The story began from a complain from my elder son, "One famous app is very expensive and need monthly payment, and too many ads for free version, I just want a simple, cheap and clean app for learning foreign language words". Myself has learned Finnish for quite many years and still not good at it. I have many execuses for it. E.g. I am too busy and too many things to do; I cannot find time to memorize foreign words. But are those execuses true or valid? NO ! Time management experts say that we do have many piecemeal or garbage time during a day. E.g. waiting for a bus, 10 minutes before sleep etc. In fact, after use the wordslet app, my Finnish has improved quite a lot, as my Finnih vocabulary number increase fast. Although I still made many grammar mistakes and use
word's basic form without grammatical inflection, believe it or not, Finnish understand me quite well. So for communication, Enough vocabulary is more important than grammar.
